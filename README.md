MY MACHINE LEARNING PROJECTS

The current repository contains projects I have worked using machine learning, neural networks.
The two data read python files were created for reading a certain txt file (not contained in this repository) and extracting the data from them, and then create a visual of them.
The data display file contains two functions, that automate the two data files, perform a preprocess on the data, run machine learning algorithms on the data, evaluate the results through error and visual representation.
The python files mentioned above were part of a project i worked for creating a prediction model for floods.
